# Gemini Competition CHrome Extension

This App has three components that power it.

- the ChromeExtension file is what was launched on the Chrome Store
- the WebSocketServer file is used to handle communication between the chrome extension and dashboard
- the next-js-Portfolio has the dashboard for the user

I have the app deeply integrated into my portfolio site, so this is a stripped down version of the source code with other projects removed from it as best as possible. Some functions had to remain.

## Usage

Our chrome extension is now approved! So here is the corrected link:

We recomind following the video for a basic usage example, and then attempt to try to apply for jobs on sites such as zip recruiter, or Indeed using the extension. (Any site works, but we did slightly more testing on those.)
