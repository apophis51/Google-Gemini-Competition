# Gemini Competition CHrome Extension

This App has three components that power it.

- the ChromeExtension file is what was launched on the Chrome Store
- the WebSocketServer file is used to handle communication between the chrome extension and dashboard
- the next-js-Portfolio has the dashboard for the user

I have the app deeply integrated into my portfolio site, so this is a stripped down version of the source code with other projects removed from it as best as possible. Some functions had to remain

## Usage

The new version of the app is not yet approved on the chrome store, but you can try out my last version here

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/malcmind-jobextention/bbmdieldafpfpmcgkjondgpiednnnhkk?authuser=0&hl=en

Its similar in functionality but the parser logic was improved in the new version.  

If you want to try it the current version. You'll need to load the chrome browser in developer mode. and manually "Load unpack" the ChromeExtension file that is in this git repo.  If the new version of the extension gets approved I will update this readme with the new link.
